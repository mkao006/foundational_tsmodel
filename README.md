# Timeseries Foundational Model Benchmark

This repository benchmark the performance of timeseries foundational models
against existing techniques.

You can run the benchmark with:
```
make run
```

To test different model, just add the model you want to test to the `main.py`,
but make sure you convert it to a `ForecastModel` class.
